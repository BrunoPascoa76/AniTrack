# anitrack

## Introduction

This app is yet another all-in-one anilist client that aims to put all the information you'll ever need in one play_circle_fill

## Motivation

The reason for me to make this app is pretty simple: put anyomi's tracking (with auto-update), anilist's overview and Otaku (Kodi)'s anime calendar all in one app, all while scratching that Flutter "itch" left after finishing my project in University.

## Disclaimer

This app is not meant for general use and is mostly for myself and a few friends. While you can use it for yourself, don't be surprised that I took "inspiration" from the above apps, as I suck at graphical design (at least the creative part)
